# Netflix Customer Churn Analysis
Python-based exploratory data analysis on Netflix customer churn using Kaggle dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores customer churn behavior in Netflix using a Kaggle dataset. 
The goal is to identify key factors that contribute to subscription cancellation and provide actionable business insights.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdulwadood11220/netflix-customer-churn-dataset
- Rows: 5,000
- Columns: 14
- Features: customerID, age, gender, subscription_type, watch_hours, avg_watch_time_per_day, last_login_days, churn

## 🔍 Key Questions
- Which customer groups are more likely to churn?  
- How does subscription type affect churn?  
- Is there a relationship between tenure and churn?

## 🛠 Tools & Skills
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Cleaning & Visualization

## 📈 Key Findings
- Customers with shorter tenure have higher churn rates.  
- Premium plan users churn less than basic plan users.  
- High monthly charges do not always predict churn.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Build a predictive model for churn (e.g., logistic regression or tree-based models)  
- Explore feature importance to better guide business decisions
